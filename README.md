## Description

The objective for this task was to practice clean code and build an app using React, Redux and Material UI. This app fetches data from a third party API. It displays the total word count of the posts retrieved, as well as the top five most frequent words. 
Users also have the ability to delete posts which are stored in the Redux store that feeds the entire app.
